# GET

* The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. 

* Requests using GET should only be used to request data (they shouldn't include data).


> Note: Sending body/payload in a GET request may cause some existing implementations to reject the request â€” while not prohibited by the specification, the semantics are undefined. It is better to just avoid sending payloads in GET requests.
