# What is Markdown?

* Markdown is a way to style text on the web. 

* You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. 

* Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

* You can use Markdown most places around Git/ GitHub/ Documents:
  * Gists
  * Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
  * Files with the **.md** or **.markdown extension**

For more information, see “[Writing on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github)” in the GitHub Help.
